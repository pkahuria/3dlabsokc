# 5 Industries Using 3D Printing in Oklahoma

Oklahoma might not be the first state that comes to mind when you think of cutting-edge manufacturing technology, but 3D printing is transforming industries right here in our backyard. At 3D Labs OKC, we've had the privilege of working with businesses across these sectors. Here's how they're using additive manufacturing to stay competitive.

## 1. Aerospace & Aviation

Oklahoma has a strong aerospace presence, with Tinker Air Force Base and numerous aviation companies calling the state home. 3D printing is revolutionizing this industry in several ways:

**Current Applications:**
- Rapid prototyping of components before expensive machining
- Creating custom tooling and fixtures
- Producing lightweight brackets and housings
- Manufacturing replacement parts for legacy aircraft

The ability to produce complex geometries that would be impossible or prohibitively expensive with traditional manufacturing makes 3D printing invaluable for aerospace applications.

## 2. Oil & Gas

Oklahoma's energy sector has embraced 3D printing for practical problem-solving:

**Current Applications:**
- Custom drill bit components and prototypes
- Replacement parts for aging equipment
- Scale models for training and visualization
- Gaskets and seals using flexible materials
- Protective housings for sensors and electronics

When equipment breaks down in the field, waiting weeks for a replacement part isn't an option. Local 3D printing services can often produce functional replacements in days.

## 3. Healthcare & Medical Devices

Oklahoma's healthcare institutions are finding innovative uses for 3D printing:

**Current Applications:**
- Anatomical models for surgical planning
- Custom prosthetic components
- Medical device prototypes
- Training simulators for medical students
- Custom orthotics and braces

While we don't produce implantable medical devices, we help healthcare innovators prototype and iterate on their designs before moving to certified manufacturing.

## 4. Agriculture & Farming

Oklahoma's agricultural roots meet modern technology:

**Current Applications:**
- Custom brackets and mounts for equipment
- Replacement parts for vintage farm machinery
- Irrigation system components
- Drone parts for crop monitoring
- Seed dispensing mechanisms

For farmers, the ability to quickly produce a broken part rather than waiting for shipping or hunting through salvage yards is a game-changer during critical planting or harvest seasons.

## 5. Education & Research

Oklahoma's universities and schools are preparing the next generation:

**Current Applications:**
- Engineering project prototypes
- Scientific models and visual aids
- Robotics team components
- Research equipment and fixtures
- Student entrepreneurship projects

We've worked with students from OU, OSU, and local high schools on everything from senior design projects to competition robots.

## The Oklahoma Advantage

What makes 3D printing particularly valuable in Oklahoma?

**Local Service, Fast Turnaround**
When you work with a local provider like 3D Labs OKC, you're not shipping files across the country and waiting for parts to arrive. You can pick up finished prints the same day or next day.

**Understanding Local Needs**
We understand Oklahoma's unique challenges—from summer heat that affects material choices to the specific needs of our dominant industries.

**Supporting Oklahoma Business**
When you work with us, you're supporting local jobs and keeping your investment in the state.

## How We Can Help Your Industry

Whether you're in one of these industries or another sector entirely, 3D printing can likely solve problems you're facing:

- Need a prototype before committing to expensive tooling?
- Have a part that's discontinued or hard to source?
- Want to test multiple design iterations quickly?
- Need custom fixtures or tooling for your specific process?

We work with businesses of all sizes, from solo inventors to established manufacturers.
