# How Much Does 3D Printing Cost? A Complete Guide

One of the most common questions we get at 3D Labs OKC is "How much will it cost to 3D print my part?" It's a fair question, but the answer isn't always straightforward. In this guide, we'll break down all the factors that affect 3D printing costs so you can better understand pricing for your projects.

## The Short Answer

For most small to medium-sized parts, you can expect to pay anywhere from **$20 to $100** at a professional 3D printing service like ours. Larger or more complex parts can range from **$100 to $500+**, depending on various factors we'll discuss below.

## Factors That Affect 3D Printing Cost

### 1. Size and Volume

The most significant factor in 3D printing cost is the amount of material used. Larger parts require more filament, more print time, and more energy—all of which increase the cost.

We typically calculate material usage in grams or cubic centimeters. A small keychain might use 5-10 grams of material, while a large decorative piece could use 500+ grams.

### 2. Material Choice

Different materials have different costs. Here's a rough breakdown:

- **PLA** - Most affordable, great for prototypes and display pieces
- **PETG** - Slightly more expensive, better durability and heat resistance
- **ABS** - Similar to PETG in cost, good for functional parts
- **TPU (Flexible)** - More expensive, used for gaskets, grips, and flexible parts
- **Nylon** - Premium pricing, excellent for high-stress mechanical parts
- **Carbon Fiber Composites** - Highest cost, maximum strength-to-weight ratio

### 3. Print Time

3D printing is a slow process. A small part might print in 30 minutes, while a large, detailed part could take 20+ hours. Print time directly affects labor and machine utilization costs.

### 4. Complexity and Detail

Parts with intricate details, thin walls, or complex geometries require:
- Slower print speeds for accuracy
- More support material (which is removed and discarded)
- Additional post-processing time

### 5. Quantity

Like most manufacturing, 3D printing has economies of scale. Printing 10 of the same part is more cost-effective per unit than printing just one, because setup time is amortized across all pieces.

## Getting an Accurate Quote

The best way to know exactly what your project will cost is to request a quote. Here's what helps us give you an accurate estimate:

1. **Send your 3D file** (STL, OBJ, or STEP format)
2. **Specify the material** you need (or ask for recommendations)
3. **Tell us the quantity** you need
4. **Mention any special requirements** (color, finish, tolerances)

## Tips to Reduce Costs

Want to keep your 3D printing costs down? Here are some strategies:

- **Optimize your design** - Reduce unnecessary thickness and volume
- **Consider infill** - You don't always need 100% solid parts
- **Choose the right material** - Don't over-engineer with expensive materials
- **Order in batches** - If you'll need more later, order them together
- **Simplify geometry** - Reduce overhangs that require support material
